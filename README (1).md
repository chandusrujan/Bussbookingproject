### README for Online Student Bus Pass Application

#### Project Overview
The Online Student Bus Pass Application is a web-based platform designed to facilitate the application and issuance of bus passes for students. This application streamlines the process by providing an online interface where students can register, log in, and apply for their bus passes without the need for physical paperwork.

#### Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **HTML Files**
  - `home.html`: The homepage of the application, providing links to registration, login, and other relevant information about the bus pass application process.
  - `login.html`: The login page where existing users can log in to access their application status or apply for a bus pass.
  - `register.html`: The registration page where new users can create an account to apply for a bus pass.

- **CSS Files**
  - `home.css`: The stylesheet for the application, defining the visual appearance of the homepage, login, and registration pages.

- **JSP Files**
  - `appreg.jsp`: Handles the application registration logic for new bus pass applications.
  - `insert.jsp`: Manages the insertion of application data into the database.
  - `bunty.jsp`: The specific function of this file will need to be determined by reviewing its content.

#### Setup Instructions
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a Java servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat) and a database system (e.g., MySQL) installed and configured on your server.
2. **Deployment**: 
   - Deploy the HTML, CSS, and JSP files to your servlet container's web application directory.
   - Configure the database connection settings within the JSP files as per your database setup.
3. **Accessing the Application**: 
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the homepage of the application (typically `http://localhost:8080/<YourApplicationName>/home.html` if running locally).
   - Use the navigation links to register, log in, or learn more about the bus pass application process.

#### Further Development
- Review and customize the `bunty.jsp` file to ensure it serves its intended purpose within the application.
- Expand the application's functionality by adding additional features such as application status tracking, admin interfaces for processing applications, and more.
